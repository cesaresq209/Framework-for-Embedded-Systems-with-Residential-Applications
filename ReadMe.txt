This repository contains a framework intended for embedded
systems development. 
The framework, along with a code generator (https://github.com/jmdiaz1742/Code_generator.git)
will allow for a faster development of embedded systems since the user will be able to 
configure the peripherals of different microcontrollers through a friendly interface, the framework
contains intuitive functions to interact with the peripherals and the architecture is designed
in such a way that higher level layers (application code) will not require modifications in 
case of a modification of a peripheral or even the microcontroller used.

Both the framework and the code generator allow the user to develop embedded code
independent of the microcontroller being used.
